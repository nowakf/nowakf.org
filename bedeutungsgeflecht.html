<li><em>It is not certain that all of the pig carcasses in the Huangpu
River came from Jiaxing.</em></li>
<li><em>There was no evidence of an epidemic among animals in
Jiaxing.</em></li>
<li><em>Water quality indicators in Jiaxing’s water treatment facilities
and at flows entering and exiting wetland areas remained normal. The
water quality at the boundary between Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai was
stable.</em> – Zhao Shumei, 2013</li>
</ol>
<p>In March 2013, pig carcasses began to be discovered floating in the
Huangpu, the smaller of the two rivers that proceed through
Shanghai.</p>
<p>By the 21st, 10,570 carcasses had been pulled from the river, with a
further 5,525 pigs discovered in upstream tributaries around
Jiaxing.</p>
<p>As for where the pigs came from, what happened to them, and who was
responsible, no clear statement was issued.</p>

<p>This is the product of the first time in a while I’ve embarked on a
serious writing project: a close look at the history and context of the
‘Huangpu pigs incident’. The book was part of a series produced by <a
