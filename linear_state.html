<div class="line-block">   “That is the corpse,<br />
     […] why corpse?<br />
     It’s made of wood,<br />
     The electricity came from a tractor,<br />
     The light always flickered to the rhythm of the engine”<br />
       — Philipp Tolziner, Sotsgorod, cities for Utopia, 1995</div>
<p>The rhythm, a flywheel jumping as fuel ignites in the piston, then
slowly relaxing. A coil of copper wire, which, an unintended microphone,
catches the jump in amplitude, then passes it on to the light’s
filaments, which glow brighter for a moment, then dim again. There is
this unexpected sensitivity and incidental character in all machines, no
matter how simple or provisional.</p>

<p><em>This is a collation of short comments, quotes, and images from
two planned cities: Magnitogorsk, and Chandigarh. Both were picked
because of their explicit purpose of forming the subjectivity of their
inhabitants, and the wider population. Both sites use spatial ordering
to produce mechanical, social, and ideological results. The work focuses
on how these projects came unstuck from three directions, first, the
mechanical and technical demands of the cities themselves; second, the
gap between the ‘tabula rasa’ conception of the sites held by the
planners, and the entrenched and complex historical reality; third, the
ability of inhabitants to take the new structures and turn them to
unpredictable ends.</em></p>
